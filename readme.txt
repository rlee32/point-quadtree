C++ implementation of a quadtree that holds points.

This quadtree attempts to assign only 1 point per leaf, up until a configurable maximum depth.

This is meant to be a lib, and the executable here is just a usage example.

Implementation notes:
1. To keep it simple, only 'double' is used for floating-point values, and only 'int' is used for integers.
